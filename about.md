Hi, I'm Miller Peterson ([Github](http://www.github.com/millerpeterson) / [LinkedIn](http://ca.linkedin.com/pub/miller-peterson/28/51b/759/en) / [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com/millerpeterson)).

I'm a software engineer living in Toronto, Canada (where Drake comes from).

Lately I'm excited about:

- [Go](https://golang.org/)
- [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)
- [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/u/millerpeterson/)
- [The Three Body Problem by Cixin Liu](http://www.amazon.ca/The-Three-Body-Problem-Cixin-Liu/dp/0765377063)
- [Captain of None by Colleen](https://vimeo.com/123892544)

Please sign my guestbook.
